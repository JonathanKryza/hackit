*Hackit* - Reddit for Facebook Groups.

==Setup==

Requires Postgresql and Python. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get all the required packages.

Import `db_backups/schema.sql` and set parameters in `config-example.py`.

Run `python web.py` to get the app running.

I'll try to setup vagrant soon so you don't have to do the above steps. Anyone want to help?

Pull requests appreciated!
